o Project analysis, User profile: create a user persona for your website:
Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she
expecting to find in your project?

The final user may be a recruiter or hiring manager at an indie or AAA game studio, looking to hire a videogame artist.
They expect to quickly understand who I am, my skills, knowledge, experience and creativity. As well as my contact information and links to other projects if they are interested.



o Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around
200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the page’s
information.

The information architecture of this CV is built on an asymmetrical two-column layout, separating the primary content from the secondary data.

The main content area, the wider column on the left, establishes a clear visual and flow. It begins with the Hero section (my name, title, and illustration) to immediately establish my identity and specialization. This is followed by a brief "About Me" section for personal context, leading into the largest part of this column: the "Projects" section. This area is designed for vertical scrolling, using large GIFs and buttons to create an engaging, portfolio-like showcase of my creative work.

The sidebar on the right functions as a persistent "stat block," directly supporting the retro-game theme while keeping all key professional data highly scannable. This information is prioritized by a recruiter's needs, starting with Contact at the very top, followed by Languages, Skills (further categorized for clarity), and finally Education.

This dual-column approach allows a user to either read my "story" on the left or get all the hard facts from the right, making the CV both appealing and efficient.



o Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words
(minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.

The visual design is deliberately built around a retro pixel-art aesthetic to immediately communicate my specialization and passion for videogame design and pixel-art. The typography is a bitmap, pixel-art font used for all text, called "Press Start 2P", creating a strong, cohesive theme. This is enhanced by a shadow on the letters, a classic 8-bit UI technique used to add depth and ensure readability against the colored background.

This low-resolution theme is reinforced by pixel-dashed dividers, which create clear, stylized separation between sections. The entire sidebar is a key visual metaphor, designed to look like a retro OS window, complete with a title bar (the "search bar" element) and an "X" (button). This transforms a simple layout element into an interactive-feeling, thematic component.

The color palette moves away from standard greys, opting for a muted, retro-toned brown and beige scheme, which gives the design a unique, "aged" feel. To bring the static page to life, animated GIFs are used for the project showcases.

Finally, this is contrasted by the personal, hand-drawn pixel-art illustration of myself to match with the theme, and by all the strong, bold, black borders of the layout to make it even clearer and consistent with pixel-art.
